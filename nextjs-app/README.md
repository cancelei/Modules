# Blueprint for Next.js App

This is a Next.js application that serves as a blueprint for future projects. It includes a main entry point, a custom App component, an API route, and several other features.

## Files and their purpose:

- `pages/index.js`: The main entry point of the application. It uses React, Next, ReactDOM, next/image, next/link, and Home.module.css from the styles folder.

- `pages/_app.js`: The custom App component. It uses React, Next, ReactDOM, globals.css from the styles folder, and favicon.ico from the public folder.

- `pages/api/hello.js`: An API route that returns a greeting message. It uses React, Next, ReactDOM, and the handler function.

- `public/favicon.ico`: The icon that appears in the browser tab.

- `public/vercel.svg`: An SVG image used in the application.

- `styles/globals.css`: The global CSS file used across the application.

- `styles/Home.module.css`: A CSS module used in the main entry point of the application.

- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the app.

- `Blueprint.md`: Contains the blueprint of the app.
