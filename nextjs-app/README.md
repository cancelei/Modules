# Next.js App Blueprint

This is a blueprint for a Next.js application. The application analyzes the folder structure and generates a blueprint file for creating a better version of the app on the next run.

## Files

The application consists of the following files:

- `pages/index.js`: The main page of the application.
- `pages/_app.js`: The custom App component.
- `pages/api/hello.js`: An API route.
- `public/favicon.ico`: The favicon for the application.
- `public/vercel.svg`: An SVG file used in the application.
- `styles/globals.css`: The global styles for the application.
- `styles/Home.module.css`: The styles for the Home component.
- `.gitignore`: The gitignore file for the application.
- `package.json`: The package.json file for the application.
- `Blueprint.md`: The blueprint file for the application.
